When you try to open the App, if you get an error message such as : "Error in initialization in Flagsmith...", you might need to upgrade your phone to a newer software version (8.0 for Android and 13 for iOS).

Once you are in the application, you will see some introduction pages to help you familiarize with the TF Connect App. You will also be asked to read and accept Threefold's Terms and conditions.

You will then be asked to choose a *Threefold Connect Id*. This ID will be used, as well as the seed phrase, when you want to recover an account. Choose wisely. And do not forget it! Here we will use TFExample, as an example.

Then, the next step is crucial! Make sure no one is around looking at your screen. You will be shown your seed phrase. Keep this in a secure and offline place. You will need the 3bot ID and the seed phrase to recover your account. This seed phrase is of utmost important. Do not lose it nor give it to anyone.

Once you've hit Next, you will be asked to write down 3 random words of your seed phrase. This is a necessary step to ensure you have taken the time to write down your seed phrase.

Finally, you will be asked to choose a 4-digit pin. This will be needed to use the Threefold Connect App. If you ever forget this 4-digit pin, you will need to recover your account from your 3bot name and your seed phrase. You will need to confirm the new pin in the next step.
