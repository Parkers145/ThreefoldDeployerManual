The easiest way to fund your deployments on the grid is by using a Threefold Connect Wallet. It is possible to fund your deployments with any stellar wallet. For those with an established Stellar wallet with a balance of TFT, start at "Sending your Stellar TFT to TFChain to be Used for Deployment"

It is available for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.jimber.threebotlogin&hl=en&gl=US) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/threefold-connect/id1459845885).

- Note that for Android phones, you need at minimum Android Nougat, the 8.0 software version.
- Note that for iOS phones, you need at minimum iOS 14.5. It will be soon available to iOS 13.

	<summary><b>Threefold Connect Installation</b></summary>

___
Either use the links above, or search for the Threefold Connect App on the Apple Store or the Google Play store. Then install and open the app. If you want to leave a 5 star review of the App, no one here will stop you!

<img src="https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_threefold_pub/raw/wethreepedia_mik/wiki/wethreepedia/farming/img/farming_tf_wallet_2.png" class="thumbnail25-100">

___
When you try to open the App, if you get an error message such as : "Error in initialization in Flagsmith...", you might need to upgrade your phone to a newer software version (8.0 for Android and 13 for iOS).

Once you are in the application, you will see some introduction pages to help you familiarize with the TF Connect App. You will also be asked to read and accept Threefold's Terms and conditions.

<img src="https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_threefold_pub/raw/wethreepedia_mik/wiki/wethreepedia/farming/img/farming_tf_wallet_3.png" class="thumbnail25-100">

___
You will then be asked to either *SIGN UP* or *RECOVER ACCOUNT*. For now, we will show how to sign up. Later in the guide, we will show you how to recover an account.

<img src="https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_threefold_pub/raw/wethreepedia_mik/wiki/wethreepedia/farming/img/farming_tf_wallet_5.png" class="thumbnail25-100">

___
You will then be asked to choose a *Threefold Connect Id*. This ID will be used, as well as the seed phrase, when you want to recover an account. Choose wisely. And do not forget it! Here we will use TFExample, as an example.

<img src="https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_threefold_pub/raw/wethreepedia_mik/wiki/wethreepedia/farming/img/farming_tf_wallet_6.png" class="thumbnail25-100">

___
Next, you need to add a valid email address. This will be used as a broad KYC. You will need to access your email and confirm the validation email from Threefold to use properly the TF Connect App Wallet.

<img src="https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_threefold_pub/raw/wethreepedia_mik/wiki/wethreepedia/farming/img/farming_tf_wallet_7.png" class="thumbnail25-100">

___
Then, the next step is crucial! Make sure no one is around looking at your screen. You will be shown your seed phrase. Keep this in a secure and offline place. You will need the 3bot ID and the seed phrase to recover your account. This seed phrase is of utmost important. Do not lose it nor give it to anyone.

<img src="https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_threefold_pub/raw/wethreepedia_mik/wiki/wethreepedia/farming/img/farming_tf_wallet_8.png" class="thumbnail25-100">

___
Once you've hit Next, you will be asked to write down 3 random words of your seed phrase. This is a necessary step to ensure you have taken the time to write down your seed phrase.

<img src="https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_threefold_pub/blob/wethreepedia_mik/wiki/wethreepedia/farming/img/farming_tf_wallet_9.png?raw=true"  class="thumbnail25-100">

___
Then, you'll be asked to confirm your TF 3bot name and the associated email.

<img src="https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_threefold_pub/blob/wethreepedia_mik/wiki/wethreepedia/farming/img/farming_tf_wallet_10.png?raw=true"  class="thumbnail25-100">

___
Finally, you will be asked to choose a 4-digit pin. This will be needed to use the Threefold Connect App. If you ever forget this 4-digit pin, you will need to recover your account from your 3bot name and your seed phrase. You will need to confirm the new pin in the next step.

<img src="https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_threefold_pub/blob/wethreepedia_mik/wiki/wethreepedia/farming/img/farming_tf_wallet_11.png?raw=true"  class="thumbnail25-100">

<h1>How to: Buy TFT</h1>

The Threefold token (TFT) is the utility token of the The Threefold Grid, a decentralized and open-source project offering network, compute and storage capacity.

Threefold Tokens (TFT) are created (minted) by the ThreeFold Blockchain (TFChain) only when new Internet capacity is added to the ThreeFold Grid by farmers. For this reason, TFT is a pure utility token as minting is solely the result of farming on the Threefold Grid.

* To **farm** TFT, read the [complete farming guide](https://forum.threefold.io/t/threefold-farming-guide-part-1/2989).

* To **buy** TFT, follow this guide.

There are many ways to buy TFT:

* You can buy TFT on [Lobstr](https://lobstr.co/)

* You can buy TFT at [GetTFT.com](https://gettft.com/gettft/)

* You can buy TFT on [Pancake Swap](https://pancakeswap.finance/swap?inputCurrency=BNB&outputCurrency=0x8f0FB159380176D324542b3a7933F0C2Fd0c2bbf)

</details>


- <details><summary><b>Connect Your TF Connect App Wallet</b></summary>

	___
	You will then need to either create a new wallet or connect an existing wallet.

	Since we are working on the Threefold ecosystem, it is very easy and practical to simply connect your Threefold Connect app wallet. You can also create a new wallet.

	Using the TF Connect wallet is very useful and quick. When you buy XLM and swap XLM tokens for TFTs, they will be directly available on your TF Connect app wallet.

	As you can see on this next picture, you need the Stellar address and secret key to properly connect your TF Connect app wallet to Lobstr:

	<img src="https://github.com/Mik-TF/gettft_tutorial/blob/main/img/gettft_18.png?raw=true"  width="15%" height="15%">

	___
	To find your Stellar address and secret key, go on the TF Connect app and select the **Wallet** section:

	<img src="https://github.com/Mik-TF/gettft_tutorial/blob/main/img/gettft_13.png?raw=true"  width="15%" height="15%">

	___
	At the top of the section, click on the **copy** button to copy your Stellar Address:

	<img src="https://github.com/Mik-TF/gettft_tutorial/blob/main/img/gettft_17.png?raw=true"  width="15%" height="15%">

	___
	Now, we will find the Stellar secret key.
	At the botton of the section, click on the encircled **i** button:

	<img src="https://github.com/Mik-TF/gettft_tutorial/blob/main/img/gettft_14.png?raw=true"  width="15%" height="15%">

	___
	That's it! You've now connected your TF Connect app wallet to your Lobstr account.

</details>

- <details><summary><b>Buy XLM with Fiat Currency</b></summary>

	___
	Now, all we need to do, is buy XLM and then swap it for TFT.
	It will be directly available in your TF Connect App wallet.

	On the Lobstr app, click on the top right menu button:

	<img src="https://github.com/Mik-TF/gettft_tutorial/blob/main/img/gettft_19.png?raw=true"  width="15%" height="15%">

	___
	Then, click on **Buy Crypto**:

	<img src="https://github.com/Mik-TF/gettft_tutorial/blob/main/img/gettft_20.png?raw=true"  width="15%" height="15%">

	___
	By default, the crypto selected is XLM. This is alright for us as we will quickly swap the XLM for TFT.

	On the Buy Crypto page, you can choose the type of Fiat currency you want.
	By default it is in USD. To select some othe fiat currency, you can click on **ALL** and see the available fiat currencies:

	You will then need to decide how much XLM you want to buy. Note that there can be a minimum amount.
	Once you chose the desired amount, click on **Continue**.

	<img src="https://github.com/Mik-TF/gettft_tutorial/blob/main/img/gettft_23.png?raw=true"  width="15%" height="15%">

	___
	Lobstr will then ask you to proceed to a payment method. In this case, it is Moonpay.
	Note that in some cases, your credit card won't accept Moonpay payments. You will simply need to confirm with them that you agree with transacting with Moonpay. This can be done by phone. Check with your bank and credit card company if this applies.

	<img src="https://github.com/Mik-TF/gettft_tutorial/blob/main/img/gettft_24.png?raw=true"  width="15%" height="15%">

	___
	Once you've set up your Moonpay payment method, you will need to process and confirm the transaction:

	<img src="https://github.com/Mik-TF/gettft_tutorial/blob/main/img/gettft_25.png?raw=true"  width="15%" height="15%">
	<img src="https://github.com/Mik-TF/gettft_tutorial/blob/main/img/gettft_26.png?raw=true"  width="15%" height="15%">

	___
	You will then see a processing window.
	This process is usually fast. Within a few minutes, you should receive your XLM.

	<img src="https://github.com/Mik-TF/gettft_tutorial/blob/main/img/gettft_27.png?raw=true"  width="15%" height="15%">

	___
	Once you've received your XLM, you will receive a notification:

	<img src="https://github.com/Mik-TF/gettft_tutorial/blob/main/img/gettft_28.png?raw=true"  width="15%" height="15%">

	___
	When your transaction is complete, you will see this message:

	<img src="https://github.com/Mik-TF/gettft_tutorial/blob/main/img/gettft_29.png?raw=true"  width="15%" height="15%">

	___
	On the Trade History page, you can choose to download the csv file version of your transaction:

	<img src="https://github.com/Mik-TF/gettft_tutorial/blob/main/img/gettft_30.png?raw=true"  width="15%" height="15%">

	That's it! You've bought XLM on Lobstr and Moonpay.

</details>

- <details><summary><b>Swap XLM for TFT</b></summary>

	___
	Now we want to swap the XLM tokens for the Threefold tokens (TFT).
	This is even easier than the previous steps.

	Go to the Lobstr Home menu and select **Swap**:

	<img src="https://github.com/Mik-TF/gettft_tutorial/blob/main/img/gettft_31.png?raw=true"  width="15%" height="15%">

	___
	On the **Swap** page, write "tft" and select the Threefold token:

	<img src="https://github.com/Mik-TF/gettft_tutorial/blob/main/img/gettft_32.png?raw=true"  width="15%" height="15%">

	___
	Select the amount of XLM you want to swap. It is recommended to keep at least 1 XLM in your wallet for transaction fees.

	<img src="https://github.com/Mik-TF/gettft_tutorial/blob/main/img/gettft_33.png?raw=true"  width="15%" height="15%">

	___
	Within a few seconds, you will receive a confirmation that your swap is completed:
	Note that the TFT is directly sent on your TF Connect app wallet.

	<img src="https://github.com/Mik-TF/gettft_tutorial/blob/main/img/gettft_34.png?raw=true"  width="15%" height="15%">

	___
	That's it. You've swapped XLM for TFT.

	You can now use your TFT to deploy workloads on the Threefold Grid.

</details>

Note that it is possible to do these steps without connecting the Lobstr wallet to the TF Connect App wallet. But doing this has a clear advantage: when we buy and swap on Lobstr, the TFT is directly accessible on the TF Connect app wallet. Ensure you always maintain a balance of 1 XLM in your Wallet, If you do not your wallet will stop functioning.

	That's it! You've successfully created an account on the TFChain thanks to the Polkadot extension. You can now access the Threefold Dashboard.

	On to the next section! Where we will transfer (or swap) TFT from the Stellar Chain on your Threefold Connect app wallet to the TFChain on the Threefold Dashboard.

	You'll see, this is so easy thanks to the Threefold Dashboard configuration.

	This will automatically write the correct address and twin ID.

	You can now write the amount of TFT you wish to send, and then click **SEND**

	> We recommend to try with a small amount of TFT first to make sure everything is OK.
	>
	> The transfer fees are of 1 TFT per transfer.

	<img src="https://github.com/Mik-TF/dashboardTutorialShort/blob/main/img/dashboard_22.png?raw=true"  class="thumbnail50-100">

	___
	You will then simply need to confirm the transaction. It is a good opportunity to make sure everything is OK.

	<img src="https://github.com/Mik-TF/dashboardTutorialShort/blob/main/img/dashboard_23.png?raw=true"  class="thumbnail50-100">

	___
	You should then receive your TFT on your Dashboard account within a few minutes.

	You can see your TFT balanced on the top of the screen. Here's an example of what it could look like:
