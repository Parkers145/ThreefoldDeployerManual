<h1> How To: Funding Your Account For a Terraform Deployment</h1>


For this section, we will create an account on the TFChain and transfer TFT from Stellar chain to TFChain. We will then be able to use the TFT and deploy workloads on the Threefold Grid.

It is simple. The main steps are:

* Download the Polkadot extension
* Create an account
* Send TFT from Stellar Chain to TFChain

Go to the Threefold Dashboard: https://dashboard.grid.tf/

If you don't have the Polkadot extension installed on your browser, you will be able to click on the download link directly on the Threefold Dashboard page:

That's it! You've successfully created an account on the TFChain thanks to the Polkadot extension. You can now access the Threefold Dashboard.

On to the next section! Where we will transfer (or swap) TFT from the Stellar Chain on your Threefold Connect app wallet to the TFChain on the Threefold Dashboard.

You'll see, this is so easy thanks to the Threefold Dashboard configuration.

This will automatically write the correct address and twin ID.

You can now write the amount of TFT you wish to send, and then click **SEND**

> We recommend to try with a small amount of TFT first to make sure everything is OK.
>
> The transfer fees are of 1 TFT per transfer.

You will then simply need to confirm the transaction. It is a good opportunity to make sure everything is OK.

You should then receive your TFT on your Dashboard account within a few minutes.

You can see your TFT balanced on the top of the screen. Here's an example of what it could look like:
